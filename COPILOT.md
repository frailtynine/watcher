General rules: 

use uv and make, not python3. If need to add some command to make, ask 

Keep python lines under 79 chars according to PEP requirements 

watch for whitespaces

Do not overcomplicate and avoid using hacky solutions. It's better not to do anything and ask than to spend a lot of time for a hacky solution
